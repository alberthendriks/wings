## Settings

When you click `Settings`, you’ll find the the following settings pages:


- Emails. Here, you can configure the emails being sent to people who sign up for your campaigns, including merge tags for first name, last name and an automatically generated confirmation url. There’s a nifty drag & drop editor that’s pretty self-explanatory.
- Integrations. Here, you can configure the connections to services like Stripe and Mailchimp, by entering an API key.
- Menus. Here, you can create a menu - typically, a main menu. Note: you can create multiple menus and use one as the default navigation menu, and set a different menu on other pages.
- Apps. Here, you will be able to configure several ‘applications’. The most important functionality it currently has, is the option to set a menu as the default main navigation menu (which you would have to have created first, see the previous bullet).
